Current dependencies tree, converted into poem by chatgpt

```
In the realm of code, where modules reside,
A web of dependencies we shall confide.
From core to activity, the threads intertwine,
Creating a graph of relationships divine.

At the heart lies the index, a gateway supreme,
Importing core types to fulfill its grand theme.
Activity manager steps forth with pride,
Calling upon EventSystem, its trusted guide.

The activity module joins the dance,
Embracing the Module's elegant stance.
It seeks solace in the EntityStore's embrace,
Building a stronghold, a secure resting place.

Commands and events, their types unfurl,
Nestled within the activity module's whirl.
They reach out to the core with declarations bold,
Extending its essence, a tale yet untold.

But battle awaits, with its fierce design,
Seeking ModuleConfig's wisdom divine.
The battle activity finds its true kin,
Uniting with PartyActivity and units within.

The battle store stands tall, steadfast and strong,
An EntityStore where its data belongs.
UnitStore and PartyService lend a hand,
Supporting the battle with their commands.

In the midst of combat, a battle ensues,
Unit calculations and loots to peruse.
The game state intertwines, the heartbeat of all,
Declared within core, standing proud and tall.

But let's not forget the debugging phase,
With modules and commands that aim to amaze.
Debug commands and types seek their space,
Nestled within the core, a sanctuary in grace.

The game module emerges, commanding the scene,
With CommandSystem and EventSystem keen.
Game stores and states hold the essence of play,
While GeneralStore adds depth in its own special way.

Map modules emerge, expanding the land,
Command handlers and event listeners at hand.
Map stores and locations, a world to explore,
With activities like travel and battles galore.

Options and shop modules grace our sight,
With commands and stores shining bright.
Their types and game states, a realm to embrace,
Where choices and purchases find their rightful place.

Lastly, the party module steps into view,
Managing activities and parties, it's true.
With party stores and interfaces so grand,
Party activities find solace in this land.

And in the village, a soulful delight,
Dependencies weave a tapestry of might.
From village command handlers to features so rare,
A harmony of resources fills the air.

Oh, the graph of dependencies, intricate and vast,
Connecting modules from first to last.
A symphony of code, a masterpiece divine,
Where modules depend on each other, entwined.
